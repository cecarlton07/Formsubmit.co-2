    <p>Welcome to Workem Fitness, where we provide the necessary knowledge and accountabilty to help you put in the work to achieve the maximum result!</p>
    <p>My name is Cameron Carlton, the Owner and Head Personal Trainer at Workem Fitness.</p>
    <p>I once struggled with my weight for many years. In the process of trying to lose weight, I tried everything from fad diets to excessively working out everyday. Though some of these exhausting things worked temporarily, none of that unsustainable nonsense provided a permanent solution to my fat problem. Yeah I admit it, I was FAT and worse of all I did not feel good about myself.</p>
    <p>It was not until I learned how to optimize these 3 simple cheat codes to fitness, that I was able to finally lose weight and keep it off.</p>
